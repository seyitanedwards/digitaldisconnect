DigitalDisconnect

A digital device you’ll want to put down.
Most screens are built to keep you hooked. This one is built to set you free.

What it is:
A pocket-sized digital minimalism device that gives you only what you actually need and nothing else.
No notifications. No infinite scroll. No dopamine drip. Just a few essential tools that serve you... and then disappear.

Core Features (v1):

✍️ Notes — jot thoughts without distraction

⏰ Reminders — remember what matters, forget the noise

🎵 Music — offline playback, your soundtrack on your terms

🎙️ Podcasts (coming soon) — learn intentionally, not endlessly

🔕 Alarm — gentle time boundaries, not jarring wake-up calls

What it’s not:

No internet
No social media
No messages
No calls
No “one more thing…”

Why it exists:
Because freedom doesn’t come from using less tech, it comes from using the right tech.
DigitalDisconnect helps you reclaim your time, your focus, and your peace.
